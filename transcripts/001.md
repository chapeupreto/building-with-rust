# Building with Rust: Luca Palmieri on True Layer and Zero to Production

Sean: Welcome to Building with Rust, a podcast where we talk to people building cool things in the Rust programming language. And today on this inaugural episode I'm joined by Luca Palmieri. Luca, how are you doing today?
[00:00:16] Luca: Not too bad, not too bad. Thanks for having me. It's been a pleasure to get this started.
[00:00:21] Sean: I have to tell the story here now for how this whole idea even got started.
[00:00:26] You posted on Twitter, I guess about a week ago now, specifically requesting a podcast like this and,  I took you up on it and I just hit you up in a DM and was like, "Hey, how would you like to be the first guest?" So I guess that was it.
[00:00:44] Luca: I think this is a podcast that needs to exist and I'm super glad that somebody picked it up.
[00:00:49] Sean: Tell me a little bit about the main Rust projects you're spending your time on currently that we'll highlight over the course of today's show.
[00:01:00] Luca: Okay. So on the open source side , I've been working on Zero to Production, which is a book on backend development in Rust, although that doesn't necessarily qualify as a Rust project, but sinking a lot of hours in there.
[00:01:14] On the more like professional side, so actual projects writing with Rust, I've been building our PayDirect product at TrueLayer. So it's a payment method based on open banking and  faster payments rails in the UK, which is built top-to-bottom with Rust.
[00:01:29] Sean: Let's start with TrueLayer.  How did that get started on a Rust stack?
[00:01:36] What was the story there?
[00:01:38] Luca: That's a longish story, I think we can go back probably a year and a half, almost two years ago.  Of course you don't just get started on a massive Rust project, from like one day to the next. So, TrueLayer is like, let's give a little bit of context. We're a fintech startup, most of our stack, is .NET Core.
[00:02:00] So C# for us like the greatest majority of the backend services with a few exceptions, which used to be in Python because of machine learning usage. And I got right to work at TrueLayer as a machine learning engineer. So I was doing something slightly different  from what I'm doing now. And as a machine learning engineer, you do Python, like that's your workhorse, day-in day-out, that's the libraries you use. And Python is very nice, but, to really go fast with Python, you need to write native modules. Like that's the way you actually get that extra gig of performance out of Python. And I can't write C. Like, just not capable. A little bit of C++ at the uni.
[00:02:41]It's a funny memory. Like I bought this C++ course, and for the exam, you have to submit a project. And my project seg faulted, even though, like, I spent probably three days trying to debug it. And so after three days, I said "I'm gonna go to the professor with this seg faulting project and we're going to chop through it together and he's going to help me fix it."
[00:03:03] I go to the professor, "Okay, well, this is what I have, I think it makes sense. I don't understand why it's seg faulting. " We spent like half an hour together and he asks me "how did you build it", like, "what have you done here and here", but we can't debug it. So after 30 minutes I go away, max grades, project still seg faulting.
[00:03:21] So I couldn't trust myself to write any module either in C or in C++. And I discovered Rust shortly before joining TrueLayer. So like three years ago. I was doing it for like numerical stuff. So I started to write small scripts in Rust.
[00:03:36] Our log parsing pipeline used to be a MapReduce job written in Python; it became a MapReduce job written in Rust. In general, we started to play around with Rust scripts, mostly for like CLIs, CI, some small Kubernetes controllers, like, no critical things, things that were not in the path of customers doing things.
[00:03:56]But it was safer to experiment and like, there was less pressure about "can we support this language as part of the platform?" And it was all like building a little bit, building the hype, like convincing the other engineers that this was an interesting technology that delivered something that we didn't have.
[00:04:13]And solved some of the problems we had, and that actually it was not that difficult to learn because of course that was like the biggest myth to demystify. Like "Rust is impossible to learn unless you're a systems programmer, otherwise it's too complicated". Like, no, actually it's, there's a learning curve. Like we need to accept there's a learning curve.
[00:04:31]But if I got there without being a systems programmer, I came from Python, you coming from like statically typed languages is going to be okay; you can do it too. It's not impossible. And like slowly I was starting to host meetups and people got interested, they got involved. Point was June last year when actually like the possibility of building a new system in Rust didn't seem so crazy as it would have probably seemed like two years back.
[00:05:00] And it was also a very mission critical system. So it's the first system when we were actually holding funds on behalf of customers. So we had a bank ledger, we had wallets, money in money out. So it was like a high gains high risk type of system compared to what we were working on before, which, still critical, but we never saw the money flowing through the system.
[00:05:22] So that makes sense. And so, like, it was an easier sell as in the type system here, it gives us a lot that will help us avoid certain mistakes that would be very, very, very costly if we were doing this in another programming language.
[00:05:36] So we started it. Now I think six months later, the project is live. Then the announcement went out last week. There's 10, 12 engineers working on it. Some had previous Rust experience. Most do not, and it's going well, it's going well. And I still have a job.
[00:05:54]Sean: So it sounds like the story here is rewriting the major service for TrueLayer in Rust and getting off of the old stack. And so that was like--
[00:06:06] Luca: No, it's not a rewrite, it's not a rewrite. This is a new product line entirely. So we are not in any shape or form doing a migration from .NET Core. Is like, okay, for this product line, we can do Rust.
[00:06:18] And the idea, I mean, that might or might not materialize depending on how things go and on adoption and the obstacles in countries, Rust is a viable programming language to choose for a new project alongside .NET. Not yet the case today, but it might be the case in the future.
[00:06:34] Sean: What sorts of applications are Rust appropriate in the context of what you are working in?
[00:06:41] When would you reach for Rust and what sorts of projects would you say "Let's build this either in the old stack or some other more appropriate stack?" What do you think?
[00:06:51] Luca: It's a nuanced argument, I would say. And it also depends on how much familiarity with the language you have. But generally speaking, what I would say is, whenever you need correctness; and of course, everybody says, "Yeah, I like my software to be correct."
[00:07:06] But like, what's the price of an error? Because that's always like the question you gotta ask yourself. And if you have complex workflows with a lot of invariants, where making a mistake can cost you some serious money or can seriously compromise your reputation.
[00:07:20] For example: data leakage or security, issues of different kinds, or moving money to the wrong place. In those systems, the Rust type system comes out as extremely useful, like being able to write state machines, being able to offload a lot of checks to the compiler at compile time and not having to write unit tests for certain types of things.
[00:07:43] Or not having to do excessive checks that then might or might not actually be enough that saves you a lot of time. The other type of system that Rust helps of course is performance sensitive systems. So if you have something where you need it either to be very fast, so that's one category. The other one is you need it to be very predictable, which is often an undiscussed aspect of Rust as programming language.
[00:08:12] Even if it's not necessarily the fastest implementation, the deterministic collection of memory done by the compiler because the whole memory reclamation is analyzed at compile time makes it so that it's very unlikely that you have, for example, spikes in latency.  Like, you know, that under a certain load, it's going to perform in a certain way.
[00:08:36] And for certain types of workloads, that's very, very, very useful and important. Now, of course, there's like, there's a gray area in the middle, which I call generic backend development, but any language will do to an extent.
[00:08:50] And so there like the biggest factor is: what does the team feel comfortable in to using? Like,  how easy is it for them to get the boat running and how easy they think, or are confident they are, that they're going to be able to support the system going forward. And that very much depends on the background, the preferences, like different people like different languages for a variety of reasons, usually depending on what they prefer to put emphasis on.
[00:09:16] So Rust is one of the stack. So sometimes people say, "Well, actually, I don't want to think about memory; you know, GC". Other people are like, "Yeah, static typing, very cool. But actually, give me a dynamic language." So that's the different school of thoughts, so to say.
[00:09:33] Sean: There was certainly a lot of convincing on your part, it sounded like, to convince your coworkers, your fellow engineers, about the virtues of Rust. Was that a hard sell or did you think it was pretty smooth? Were people pretty receptive to it?
[00:09:50] Luca: How do I classify that? Was it a hard sell? I mean, it was not a given. I think the outcome was definitely not determined at the beginning because a programming languages is a significant piece of technology in the stack of a company.
[00:10:05] I like to think of the stack of a company as a pyramid. The closer something is to the top the fewer types of that item you have. So you might have 500 libraries at the bottom, and then you have maybe a couple of web frameworks, and then you have a few programming languages, and maybe you have one container orchestrator, right? You don't run many of those.
[00:10:28] And the closer you are to the top, the more difficult it is to move away from something. And the more investment it requires to actually support that technology in a way that is productive. And programming languages in particular have a lot of ramifications. So let's start from the basics, right?
[00:10:45] So you want to put a  service into  production, at TrueLayer, for example, and no matter what the service is written into, that service needs to be deployed in Kubernetes. So it needs to be able to run in a container. So you need to have a way to package it and ship it. And it exposes a certain amount of telemetry data, like certain types of intermediate metrics, need to expose, open telemetry traces, logs in a certain format and so on and so forth.
[00:11:12] All of this is where that, for example, for a programming language, you generate once but you need to put the initial investment to actually do it. So there's a cost that you need to pay at least once. Usually you need to do a few iterations to actually get it right.
[00:11:27] But let's say it this once. Now you have a piece of tech in the cluster, and maybe you have two or three, five, six, 15 services. That basically means that going forward, you need some level of Rust knowledge. Because you have a stack that is generating revenue, hopefully, that is written in Rust.
[00:11:44] So even if the super excited engineer like myself, leaves the company  (happy case) , goes under a bus  (unhappy case) , somebody's got to maintain that stack . So when you say "yes", you're not saying yes to something that ends in two months when the project is finished.
[00:11:59] You're saying yes, to the lifetime, like the total maintenance cost for that project. And what does that mean? It means that you will have to hire for Rust talent. So like, okay, how many Rust engineers are there that we can hire? Can we train them?
[00:12:15] Do we need to train the engineers we have? So like, if some engineers want to move teams or they need to start supporting these new systems, they need to upskill themselves to learn the language, which first of all means that is there excitement? The question was like, does the engineering organization, is it interested in supporting Rust?
[00:12:34] And the second thing is, do we want to put in the time and the money to give them an opportunity to learn the language and then become proficient into it? It was not necessarily the hardest sell because of course, a lot of work had been done before and people got excited at, into the community in different ways. But regardless, the consequences of it made it a fairly heavy choice to make.
[00:12:56] Like, it's not something you do lightly. And you see that because companies generally speaking, even if they go polyglot, they don't support like tens of languages. I don't remember which company was it, but the terminology I like is there's like the "paved way". Like you can do whatever you want, but we're going to support one, two, three, four golden stacks.
[00:13:17]And that's where we're going to make sure that everything runs smoothly. You go outside of the paved way, they can do it. But for a smaller company like TrueLayer, so in like the 80, 90 engineers, so, big, but not huge, like the cost of supporting five, six different stacks is just too high, you do a lot of things but you do none well.
[00:13:37] So adding another core piece of programming language, it's a significant endeavor.
[00:13:44]Sean: To go back back to  the process of what you guys were actually building, what were some of those main challenges and horror stories that came out of that process?
[00:13:54]Luca: I'm glad to say, we don't have too many horror stories. We didn't find some terrible bugs in some open source libraries is that we didn't find them in production, which makes a very different fun experience when you find out in testing.
[00:14:08]So how did it go? Well, it all started with one engineer, or just myself, then that became five roughly when the project was at full speed, and it goes roughly 50, 50, like 50% of the engineers with no experience whatsoever using Rust, 50% of the engineers with some experience, either commercial or open source, depending on where they're coming from.
[00:14:31] And of course the first question was: are we going to be able to get the engineers who have not used Rust before in production to be proficient and contribute to the project? And that was a resounding success. After a month, roughly, depending on the level of seniority, people were contributing, even in particularly hairy parts of the code base without too much handholding.
[00:14:51] But yes, there was the occasional "the compiler is laughing me in the face with lifetimes because I'm doing some asynchronous closures". And that you go there and say, "Okay, let me help you here." But generally speaking, mastering the subset of the language that was necessary to drive backend services, that was fairly easy.
[00:15:07] It was a normal learning curve for a programming language. The stuff that was a little bit more tricky, I would say, was figuring out the tool set. If you think about it, like asynchronous Rust is fairly young. Async/await was stabilized, I think, November 2019 if I get the month right, more or less. So that's a year and two months from today. And after it was stabilized and it took a few months for everybody to migrate, then people started to explore the space, libraries changing,  different defaults. So there's a lot. But there's a lot of like pockets of functionality. So there's a library that does very well this bit.
[00:15:49] And there's a library that does very well these other bits. Okay, how do we assemble that into  basically our own flavor of Rails or Django, which we can use to have like a toolkit, which makes it fast to churn out backend services. Because of course we're not writing a monolith. In our case, we're writing a microservice architecture.
[00:16:08] I think at the end, we have something like 12, 13 services, and then a mixture of REST APIs, JPC APIs, RabbitMQ message consumers. Like, how do we make sure that all these things make sense? I think that was useful to have some more experienced Rust programmers, to steer people away from things that would have been huge time sinks.
[00:16:30] So for example, certain charges were made at the beginning. Like, okay, our executor is Tokio, and we're not going to go through the hurtle of making things executor agnostic because we don't need it. And we're  going to steer away from any library that is not using Tokio or is not executor agnostic.
[00:16:47] Yes, we can make it work. No, it's too complicated. I don't want to I waste engineer time on this. I don't like the fact that I had to make that compromise but that simplified things; it made it possible to go forward. Or we're gonna standardize on Actix Web, because it's stable. Maybe it's not the nicest, but we can go with it.
[00:17:07] And so , we built an ecosystem of internal libraries that made it very very easy to stitch together a service. So that you would generally just write the business logic and the tasks and leave most of the infrastructure to these internal libraries and that worked fairly well for us. So it allowed us, for example, to do migrations very fast when the ecosystem is changing. That allowed us to make sure best practices, as we found them, were consistently applied. Because of course the other problem was, and that's a little bit where Zero to Production comes in the picture.
[00:17:40] There's no real guide or tutorials at the intermediate level to do backend in Rust. So yeah, the Rust book, it's like, okay, this is Rust, this programming language, great.  Async guides of different types or the usual like "Intro to Rocket" or "Intro to Actix Web" are gonna teach a few things and that's been the extent of it. That's not enough. Like how do I onboard an engineer then needs to work on these systems? What do I give them to read?
[00:18:08] And the third one, I guess, the biggest was, we cannot consider the open source libraries you use as a commodity. Like, that is something that in more mature ecosystems you can do, right? So you say, "Well, I'm using Django. I'll never contribute back to Django", because the likelihood that I'm going to find that critical bug, like so many people have used it before me that much larger scale deployments, how unlucky do I have to be to be the one that finds the critical vulnerability?
[00:18:40] Like you cannot do that for Rust; the ecosystem is much more immature. And like, you need to factor in that a certain amount of time is going to be contributing back, mostly patches, upstream. You don't know which libraries are going to need them, but you're sure you're going to find some.
[00:18:57] And I think in four months, we contributed probably four or five across a bunch of projects. I think we found a core dump in Tracing when you mix two different Tracing subscribers. We found an issue in the Open Telemetry instrumentation.
[00:19:12]We did find stuff, and then we put engineers there. "Okay, let's try to patch and contribute it  upstream." And if you don't have the time to do that, then probably you want to stick to a more mature ecosystem. So like that needs to be factored in.
[00:19:27] Sean: Yeah, that's a really interesting point that I hadn't thought of.
[00:19:30]The last few questions I still had about your work at TrueLayer was: if you had to estimate what percentage of total code is Rust and all other programming languages, what do you think that estimate would be right now?
[00:19:44] Luca: Ooh, that's a tough one. What would it be? I think Rust might be at this point in time 20%, maybe. It's one product of three.
[00:19:53]Sean: Do you see that 20% gaining ground as time goes on? Or do you think it'll stay roughly about 20%? What do you think?
[00:20:02] Luca: It's very difficult to say, for a variety of reasons . For our older products in C#, there's actually no real reason to go and rewrite things ; it wouldn't buy us anything that is worth the effort. That's roughly going to stay there. Is the Rust share gonna increase? Depends. Does the new product  do well so that we invest more into it and expand geographically?
[00:20:25] And so that grows, that definitely is gonna increase. If TrueLayer is going to do well and build new products, and Rust still is a fairly liked technology within engineering, then there's a chance that those are going to be in Rust. So it very much depends on a lot of things which are not necessarily engineering-driven. It's more of like the business side and how things are gonna go.
[00:20:46] Sean: Okay. That makes sense. Let's move on then to talking about Zero to Production. I've read a decent chunk of it. I haven't gotten through everything. But I read most of the early chapters. I read the deployment one . Just want to say like that one, I think is super important because I feel like oftentimes  deployment is just not talked about enough. And so that one was a real diamond in the rough of a post . But yeah, you talked a little bit about the initial motivation for Zero to Production.
[00:21:18] I think I read a tweet. I wasn't sure if you said you finished it, but how's the progress on that going?
[00:21:23] Luca: That's the same when like your relatives ask you "do you have a girlfriend?" at Christmas. I think I'm slightly, what am I? 66% of the book. It turned out to be a little bit longer than expected.
[00:21:36]  Sean: How much of the content in Zero to Production is stuff that you've had to kind of inject from your own learning and how much was informed by your daily work at TrueLayer?
[00:21:49] Luca: That's a very good question. I think definitely like, the shape of the book and like what chapters are in there and the order in which they are tackled was very much informed by my work at TrueLayer. Specifically like the work of onboarding new engineers onto the team that were not coming from Rust.
[00:22:07]They would either come in generally from C# or JavaScript. Which, I mean, prototypically are two big backgrounds, right?  Static language. Object-oriented. Dynamic language with some types if you're using TypeScript. Functional patterns, because mostly we're React programmers.
[00:22:22] If these people are trying to learn the language to do this thing, what do they stumble on?  And that was a little bit like the reader persona in my mind. What do they need to see? And that's how the book was based. At that point, you always try to do better than you do the first time.
[00:22:38] Right? So like when I was doing it at TrueLayer, it was a little bit "discovere as you go". When I was redoing it in Zero to Production, certain things actually better maybe than what we did the first time, because I had more time to go over them or just, I spent the time to actually build a library for the book that made certain things simpler.
[00:22:58]That's, like, how stuff like cargo-chef in that deployment chapter was built. That was built because I was writing the book and I was like, "I can't teach people to do like 700 lines of making mock files and then they need to delete to get caching". This looks horrible but like, is there a better way?
[00:23:17] I sank a weekend into it, I was like, "Okay, I think I can do it". I think that the daily experience factors in a lot, but it's not necessarily like the code you will find if tomorrow you were to work in an active codebase.
[00:23:29]Sean: I think you even mentioned this in the book, but obviously one of the biggest pain points of a book like this is perhaps how quickly it will get outdated. Are there other steps to kind of combat that? Or how much are you kind of thinking about that with this book?
[00:23:46] Luca: That's definitely an element. The book has been ongoing for six months and already I had like to update it at least three times, because like major libraries releasing breaking changes. So yeah, that's definitely a concern. So there's two sides to the problem to me. So on one side is, I spend a lot of effort in trying to make sure the book teaches you more than just the APIs of the libraries that you're using.
[00:24:14] So like, focusing on the concepts. And then of course, tying that in with the practice. So like go get that library that helps you achieve that piece of work. So for example, okay, let's talk about observability and we'll talk about Log and we'll talk about Tracing and then teach you enough of Tracing to achieve what we need to achieve.
[00:24:33] But it's not the Tracing documentation. Like, there's a documentation, it's there, and you refer to  that. Now let's suppose that Actix Web is not any more one of the major web frameworks. That means that two chapters needs to be seriously edited, because you need to like bring in another web framework, change a bunch of stuff. But that does not invalidate the book as-is. I know that even when it's finished, there's a certain amount of maintenance work that I need to factor in, which might be more or less, depending on how my investments in current libraries, like, mirror the future. But apart from that, I'm fairly confident it's not going to be useless. So let's say two years; maybe in five.
[00:25:15] Sean: I will say, I think you I've done a really good job surveying a lot of those really important topics and that you're right. Even if some of the details for how you perform observability in Rust become outdated, at the end of the day, that's still a massively important topic, same with deployment and all that other good stuff. I think you picked a really good bunch of topics there for the book.
[00:25:37]From some of the other blog posts that I've read on, on your blog, you contributed to ndarray and a lot of the linear algebra libraries in Rust. Do you still do any of that machine learning and math stuff, or is it on the back burner right now?
[00:25:51] Luca: Oh, it's definitely on the back burner. There was a period of time where I was doing backend as a job and ML as open source. But the cost of the mental switch was too high. Like, if you're talking microservices, caching patterns, day in day out, and then you go in the evening "Okay, let me remember how to implement Cholesky decomposition".  Like it's a big jump. And I just wasn't able to do it, like took me too much time to get back into it, to actually enjoy it in the end, like doing the open source work. So what I did three months, four months afterwards, was "Okay, let's move the libraries to people that can maintain them".
[00:26:34]So for example, linfa, which is the framework for classical machine learning, I said, "Okay, folks in the Rust machine learning working group, I trust you. I'm sure you're going to do good stewardship. Do you want to take it on?". And they were like "Yeah, absolutely, we think it's an important project. If you want to donate it, we're happy to maintain it." Great.
[00:26:52] And for the others like ndarray, ndarray-stats, there's already a community around them. So I just took a step back.
[00:26:58] Sean: Let me then ask your professional opinion then as an ex-ML engineer: what do you think is the state of machine learning in Rust, do you think there's potential there? There's kind of like even any chance or any consideration that someone would be like, "Hey, let's use Rust instead of Python for machine learning"?
[00:27:17] Luca: Yeah, Rust instead of Python, I don't see that happening pretty much ever. My personal opinion. I don't see a future where that is the reality. I think a slightly more interesting question is, do we see a future in which instead of doing Python/C, people do Python/Rust? Absolutely.
[00:27:36]And I think the ecosystem is not as mature yet, so if you need to build algorithms in Rust, there's a chance you might have to do some like fundamental building block work that you wouldn't do if you were doing that in Python or C++, because some of the libraries are not as polished. Some of the language features are maybe not necessarily there:  specialization, const genetics, definitely some of those, but you can get off the ground.
[00:28:04] Like I know for a fact that there are companies using Rust quite extensively to do machine learning and they generally belong  to specific subsets. But for example, they're doing ML on memory-constrained devices, where they say, "Okay, I'm not going to deploy Python there. So I need something a little bit lower level" and I think it's easier to do it in Rust, even considering like the ecosystem level of maturity compared to do that in C++. So they're making these choices and these are like companies I interacted with when I was  maintaining ndarray-stats, for example. They're like, "Well actually, we're using that in production."
[00:28:40] I was like "Wow. Okay, what are you doing?" So I think that's gonna happen. It's about industry, industry funding. Like it all boils down to corporate backing, to an extent, especially if we look at stuff like neural networks, deep learning. You cannot keep the pace of something like TensorFlow or something like PyTorch if you're relying on five or six contributors doing that in their spare time.
[00:29:08] So at a certain point, there needs to be somebody who says: "I want to bet on this technology and I'm going to fund some people to work on it". And then maybe you're going to see that becoming more mainstream. But at this point, I think it's still fairly niche. That's a fair assessment.
[00:29:25] Sean: I think we'll wrap up with  one last question here, which is: do you enjoy backend work more than the machine learning work you used to do?
[00:29:35] Luca: Oh, that's a very loaded question. I mean, nobody pointed a gun at me and said "Go do backend". So I, I had a choice at a certain point within the same company. So within TrueLayer I just say, "Okay, well actually, let me stay here, playing with my models. Or yeah, I want to do the backend stuff." The reason I switched to backend is a bit multifaceted. So some of those are technical and it's like the enjoyment of the day to day.
[00:29:59] Some are more, ethical, professional kind of reasons. On the technical side, I think the ML workflow and the way to approach ML problems is 10 years behind the way people work on backend in general, software engineering systems . The MLOps stack is just coming out. ML operations is just understanding how to build these models.
[00:30:22] And there's a lot more cowboy-ish behavior in like booting stuff. It's bearing a lot of weight, and you're putting it like in the wild using it to do things. There's sometimes a dangerous like effects on people without necessarily understanding if you have direct level of operational maturity to guarantee that it's going to be okay. If that makes sense.
[00:30:43] That XKCD comic, which I often copy paste to people, like the guy who was like stirring the big pile, just hoping that he's going to get different results. A lot of the work that I was doing in neural networks felt a little bit like that.
[00:30:57]We stirred these like big matrices pie and we hope we're going to get something different. There was a lot of craft, but not in the good sense. I mean, a lot of the day-to-day, which I didn't necessarily enjoy. So that it's probably like the more pleasure aspect of the work.
[00:31:13] I think on backend, I feel like much more control over, like what I put in, what I'm going to put out. It feels way more linear than what it used to be when I was doing ML work. On the opposite side, it was just a matter of perspective. Like when I went back on the job market before joining TrueLayer and I was like "Okay, I'm looking for machine learning engineering positions."
[00:31:33] And what I realized was, well, if you don't want to work for companies doing advertising, you don't want to do quant or like more finance-y stuff, then actually there's not many verticals when they actually legitimately need a machine learning engineer. A lot of people need a data scientist or people who can crunch numbers with a more business-y flavor.
[00:31:59]But the actual ML artwork, like we're going to build models, do things. There's not many verticals that need that. And I was like, "I'm not interested in that. Like, I don't want to do advertising. That's not what I'm looking for." Well, when I look at it and I look at it, "Okay, let me see what people are looking for?" Developers.
[00:32:20] Well, everything. Like, software is eating the world, and we can repeat that ad nausem. My skillset does not restrict the vertical, what I can go to work. And to me that feels like a net improvement compared to where I was when I was doing ML.
[00:32:36] Sean: Cool, makes sense. It seems like you're happy with where you're currently at and that's great to see, and that it involves working in Rust. So that's super cool.
[00:32:46] Luca: That's a nice combo.
[00:32:47] Sean: Yeah. Cool. All right. Thanks so much, Luca. I think that's about it. We'll go ahead and wrap this, this conversation up. Unless, I don't know you had any other, I suppose, last minute things you like wanted to bring up?
[00:33:00] Luca: Any last decoration to put on record? No, I'm fine. I think I've said everything I wanted to say.
[00:33:05] Sean: So to the listeners, what social media stuff do you want to plug here while you have the mic?
[00:33:11]Luca: You can find me on Twitter pretty much. It's @algo_luca. And from there you can find everything else you want to find.
[00:33:19]Sean: All right. So yeah. Thanks so much again, Luca, for taking the time. This was a lot of fun. And,  thanks for,  again, initially for the idea and for a really fun recording session on this inaugural podcast. So thanks everyone. And we'll see you all in the next one.
[00:33:33] Luca: Bye bye.
